# TsuruTune CUDA/GPU Optimization Requirements
# For GPU acceleration with TensorRT and CUDA support

# Include all CPU requirements first
-r requirements-cpu.txt

# PyTorch with CUDA support
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# cupy-cuda12x>=12.0.0  # Uncomment for CUDA 12.x

# Additional GPU optimization libraries
# pycuda>=2022.1  # For direct CUDA programming (optional)

# TensorFlow GPU support (if using mixed optimization)
# tensorflow-gpu>=2.13.0  # Alternative to CPU-only tensorflow
